# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

This README provides a central reference to the project management processes used at OctoAcme, summarizing the key workflows, roles, communication strategies, and quality assurance practices that help our teams deliver consistent results. It also includes direct links to all core process documents, making it easy for anyone to discover, navigate, and apply the latest standards and practices.

## Overview of Project Management at OctoAcme

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative project lifecycle: **Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Close & Retrospective**. Projects begin with clear problem and goal definition, measurable success metrics, and dedicated stakeholder alignment. Planning emphasizes actionable backlogs, well-defined acceptance criteria, and transparent prioritization—managed collaboratively via GitHub issues and boards.

Core roles include Project Managers (scheduling, risk, delivery), Product Managers (vision, backlog, outcomes), Developers (building, testing, reviewing), QA/Testing (quality and acceptance), and Stakeholders (inputs and approvals). Communication is frequent and structured: daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates ensure alignment and early risk visibility.

Quality assurance is baked in at every stage, with requirements for unit/integration/end-to-end tests, peer reviews, security scanning, and manual QA before release. Continuous improvement is achieved through regular retrospectives, tracking action items, and sharing lessons learned across the team.
